/**
 * A sample paymaster that define itself as a token to pay for gas.
 * The paymaster IS the token to use, since a paymaster cannot use an external contract.
 * Also, the exchange rate has to be fixed, since it can't reference an external Uniswap or other exchange contract.
 * subclass should override "getTokenValueOfEth to provide actual token exchange rate, settable by the owner.
 * Known Limitation: this paymaster is exploitable when put into a batch with multiple ops (of different accounts):
 * - while a single op can't exploit the paymaster (if postOp fails to withdraw the tokens, the user's op is reverted,
 *   and then we know we can withdraw the tokens), multiple ops with different senders (all using this paymaster)
 *   in a batch can withdraw funds from 2nd and further ops, forcing the paymaster itself to pay (from its deposit)
 * - Possible workarounds are either use a more complex paymaster scheme (e.g. the DepositPaymaster) or
 *   to whitelist the account and the called method ids.
